/* AST: Abstract syntax tree 
 * Structures to build an AST.
 * An AST provides extra data over the CFG: Control Flow Graph, NODES,
 * because it describes structure (if...then...else, and loops), and therefore closer to the 
 * final output in the programming language of choice.
 * It is used to group NODES together, and associate them with structure. e.g. Part of a for() loop.
 * This will make is easier to read the resulting source code because
 * before everything was if...then...else, but now a new construct of a for() loop can be
 * shown, as it is a special case of the if...then...else.
 * Also, the if...then...else can now contain lists of statements, instead of if...then goto...else goto.
 * Thus, reducing the amount of gotos in the resulting source code, making it easier to read.
 * FIXME: At first this is not a proper full AST of each program statement, but 
 * it is instead an AST at the NODE level.
 * FIXME: jump tables and call tables not taken into account yet.
